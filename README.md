# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jorge Amorim!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more, develop better and keep on improving as a developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a SAP ABAP Developer for more than six years. My goal is to become a full stack SAP developer, working with CDS Views, Fiori Elements and Fiori Freestyle applications. 
- Take a look at my repositories, as well, so you can learn about me :)

## ðŸŽ“ My upcomming projects:
For now, I am starting to develop some applications on the SAP BTP Trial account, using Eclipse and ABAP Development Tools for the backend. For the frontend, I used the Business Application Studio (BAS) from BTP Trial Account as well.
- Using CDS Views (Basic, Composite and Consumption) gather all the backend information and serve to the frontend as OData services.
- On Frontend, either with SAPUI5 freestyle or Fiori Elements, create applications with mockup data.
Currently I am working on a Vendor Performance Cockpit which will be a Fiori Elements application that shows the vendors performance based on:
- Average delivery time;
- Percentage of late deliveries;
- Registered complaints;
- Comparison of prices per item;
- Monthly trend in purchasing volume;

The goal of this project is to have an application like this:
